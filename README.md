# Project Wine Collection 

[Wine Collection] (https://dizzy-ray-cuff.cyclic.app/)

The Wine Collection is a web application built with Express.js that allows users to explore and discover a variety of wines. You can look up the entire collection of wines or choose a random wine to explore new tastes. Additionally, you can leave a review for a wine that you specifically liked, one that you didn't. 

This project is a collaborative effort, and GitHub serves as the central platform for our development and cooperation. We leveraged GitHub's features to streamline collaboration, track changes, and manage our codebase effectively.
